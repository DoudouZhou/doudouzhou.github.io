## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biostatistics at Harvard University, working with Prof. Tianxi Cai and Junwei Lu. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in August 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Hao Chen. Before that, I received my B.S. in Statistics and B.E. in Computer Science (dual) from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019. 

## Research Interests

- **Methodology and theory for electronic health records (EHR) data:** federated learning, reinforcement learning, network analysis, representation learning, large language models, graph nerual networks
- **High-dimensional Statistics:** graph/rank-based methods for hypothesis testing, transfer learning

## News

- **[Jul. 2024]**
