## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics & Data Science at [the National University of Singapore](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/). I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biostatistics at Harvard University from 2022 to 2024, working with Prof. Tianxi Cai. I  received a Ph.D in Statistics 2022 from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis), advised by Prof. Hao Chen. Before that, I received my B.S. in Statistics and B.E. in Computer Science (dual) from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019. 

### To Prospective Students: 
I am seeking self-motivated students to join my research group or collaborate with me. If you are interested in collaborating, please email me your CV along with a brief introduction about yourself.

### Research Fellow: 
We are inviting applications for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow position in the Department of Statistics and Data Science.

Interested candidates are encouraged to submit the following materials: (1) CV or Resume (2) A short research statement outlining your previous and current work, as well as your proposed research directions and interests (3) Names and contact information for three references. 

## Research Interests

I am interested in developing statistical methodology and theory for electronic health records (EHR) data analysis. I'm also developing practical tools for analyzing high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. I mainly work on representation learning, federated learning, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, network analysis, graph neural networks, large language models, and high-dimensional statistics. Recently, I am interested in:

- Multimodal and multi-institutional representation learning for data harmonization and knowledge graph integration.
- Federated reinforcement learning for precision medicine.
- Transfer learning of heterogeneous domains.
- Graph-based and rank-based methods for high-dimensional hypothesis testing.
